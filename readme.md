## Purpose

Each week we wanted to feature a photo on a theme from a different photographer. We'd then also share photos from other photographers on that same theme. This first week's feature was **architectural photography**.

## Requirements

1. I needed to build a system that once in place could be easily updated each week by a non-technical member of our team.
2. The system would need to automatically display relevant info about the featured photographer such as his or her name, a profile photo, location, and social media links.
3. The system would also need to pull in a collection of similarly themed photos and display those on the page.

## My Solution

I built a template for our blog that could be copied and edited in a few places to generate fresh content each week. I chose to use the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation). Unsplash is a website that provides, in their own words, "Beautiful, free photos. Gifted by the worldâ€™s most generous community of photographers.".

I used javascript's fetch method to make calls to a couple of Unsplash's API endpoints to pull in the info I needed.

1. I called the `users` endpoint which allowed me to get a user's public profile.
  - With this call I was able to access the user's name, profile photo, location, and social media links.

2. I also called the `collections` endpoint which allowed me to retrive a single collection.
  - We had curated photos into a collection based on each week's photo theme. I could simply make a call to this endpoint, passing it the `:id` of our collection and I'd access the image in this manner.

I then used javascript to render HTML elements to the page with custom classes. I next used CSS and some Bootstrap to style the HTML that was rendered on page.
